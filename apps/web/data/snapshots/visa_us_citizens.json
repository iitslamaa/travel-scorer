Registration required after 7 business days. Russia signed the \"Shared Values Visa\" law on August 19, 2024, aimed at simplifying the residence permits for citizens of countries that do not conform to Russia's traditional spirit and values. This means that one can obtain a three-month temporary residency without passing the exam. The focus of this law is to simplify the residence permit for foreign citizens with traditional Russian spirit and values. As long as they comply with Russian values, foreign citizens do not need to prove their knowledge of Russian language, Russian history, or Russian law (without examination), and can obtain a temporary residence permit for three months. By simplifying the process, more people can be attracted to settle in Russia, and these foreign citizens must come from countries that oppose Russian values. This list applies to 47 regions, including United States. American citizens may receive multiple-entry visas valid for three years. Residents of Alaska who are members of the indigenous population do not require a visa to visit Chukotka Autonomous Okrug if they have relatives (blood relatives, members of the same tribe, native people who have similar language and cultural heritage) in Chukotka. Individuals must be invited by a relative in Chukotka and must leave Chukotka within 90 days. Entry points are in Anadyr , Provideniya , Lavrentiya and Uelen . The U.S. government advises its citizens not to visit Russia for any reason for the following reasons: Danger associated with the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine . The risk of harassment or wrongful detention by Russian security officials. The arbitrary enforcement of local laws. The possibility of terrorism. US citizens in Russia are advised to leave immediately.",
