Protests and demonstrations against military rule can occur on significant dates. The military has responded to those protests with violence and by&nbsp;arbitrarily detaining protesters and bystanders.\nThe Department has determined that U.S. nationals are at&nbsp;significant risk of wrongful detention by military regime authorities. Wrongfully detained U.S. nationals have been held in prison for years, often in poor conditions and without fair and transparent treatment or consistent access to U.S. Embassy officials or their families.\nDue to the unpredictable nature of ongoing armed conflict and potential civil unrest in Burma, U.S. government employees working in Burma may be prohibited from traveling within the country.\nDue to the risks in the country, dependents under the age of 21 cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in Burma.\nArmed conflicts&nbsp;occur throughout Burma, and the potential for civil unrest is high.

From January to December 2024, the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon calculated an average of 21 explosions per month detonated against regime personnel and facilities in Rangoon. Outside of Rangoon, there have been IED attacks against checkpoints and military, administrative, and police facilities.\nLand mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO)&nbsp;exist throughout Burma, and their locations are often not marked or otherwise unidentifiable. The military regime will often&nbsp;arbitrarily enforce local laws, including detaining individuals without fair and transparent treatment. Foreigners, including U.S. citizens, are not excluded from this practice. U.S. citizens traveling or residing in Burma may be detained, and regime authorities could deny a prisoner access to U.S. consular services or information about the alleged crime.\nLocal law enforcement officials may also detain and/or deport U.S. citizens for speaking out or protesting against the military regime, including on their personal social media accounts, and for sending private electronic messages critical of the military regime, regardless of whether they were physically in Burma when they did so.\nBurma has&nbsp;limited and/or inadequate healthcare and emergency medical resources.\nAs of April 2024, the Burma military regime began implementing a military conscription law for males up to age 45 and females up to age 35. The military regime may prevent departure of people they view as eligible for conscription, including U.S. citizens who previously held Burmese nationality, and force them into the military.\nCrime in Burma has been increasing. Violent crime against foreigners is rare, but there have been incidents involving attacks by taxi drivers and muggings. People are advised to take particular care when taking taxis late at night.\nForeign nationals, including U.S. citizens, have been trafficked into Burma and forced to work in internet scam centers, often located in active conflict zones along Burma's eastern borders.

Belarus will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Belarusian citizen or have a claim to Belarusian citizenship.&nbsp;\n\nBelarus repeatedly has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens.&nbsp;\nThe Belarusian government has prevented dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens from leaving the country, and in some cases forced dual citizens into mandatory military service.\n\nDemonstrations\nIn Belarus, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations.&#8239;Belarusian authorities have used excessive force to disperse demonstrators, including people peacefully demonstrating.&nbsp; Bystanders, including foreign nationals,&#8239;face the possibility of arrest or detention.\nU.S. citizens near demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment or mistreatment by Belarusian officials.&nbsp; Belarusian officials unevenly enforce laws and regulations. Belarusian authorities have targeted individuals associated with independent and foreign media.&nbsp;\nBelarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of individuals, including U.S. citizens, accused of links to opposition parties and involvement in political protests, even if these links or associated activities occurred outside Belarus.&nbsp;\nAbout 1,100 prisoners are currently in prison or otherwise detained for political activities that may not be considered crimes in the United States.&nbsp; The Belarusian authorities have denied prisoners access to their embassy and lawyers, as well as restricted communication with family outside prison Conditions in Belarusian detention facilities are extremely poor and there are credible accounts of prisoners being mistreated and abused while in custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nElectronic devices\nReconsider bringing electronic devices into Belarus. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Belarus are monitored by Belarusian security services. Belarusian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices, including information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.\nAir Travel\nThere are few commercial air travel options available into and out of Belarus. Flights could be unavailable on short notice, and the availability of other transportation options could change at any time. Those wishing to leave Belarus should make their own travel plans. The U.S. government can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave.&nbsp;\nBorder crossings with neighboring states sometimes close with little notice. U.S. citizens should regularly reevaluate departure plans in the event of an emergency.&nbsp;\nOn May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities improperly forced the landing of a commercial plane transiting through Belarusian airspace in order to arrest an opposition journalist who was a passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nOn February 24, 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an ongoing Advisory Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) banning U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. pilots, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating in the Minsk Flight Information Region (UMMV) due to safety-of-flight risks associated with ongoing hostilities.&nbsp; The&#8239;Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices includes more information.\nReview the&#8239;country information page&#8239;for additional information on travel to Belarus.\nIf you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and travel to Belarus:&#8239;\n\nPrepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.\nShare important documents, log-in information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.) funeral wishes, etc.\nLeave DNA samples with your medical providers in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\nDevelop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you&#8217;ll confirm you&#8217;re safe (text or call).&nbsp; Specify how often you will do this.\nHave evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Review the information on what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency while overseas.&nbsp;\nVisit our website for&#8239;Travel to High-Risk Areas.\nConsider the unique risks of possessing dual U.S.-Belarusian nationality.\nReconsider bringing electronic devices to Belarus.\nLog out of all social media accounts, and do not access personal social media accounts while in Belarus.\nAvoid demonstrations and crowds.\nCheck local and international media for breaking events. Be prepared to adjust your plans based on new information.\nKeep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.\nEnroll in the&#8239;Smart Traveler Enrollment Program&#8239;(STEP) to get important updates and alerts from the U.S. embassy or consulate. Enrolling helps the U.S. embassy or consulate contact you or your emergency contact in an emergency.&nbsp;\nReview the&#8239;Country Security Report&#8239;for Belarus.\nVisit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for the latest Travel Health Information for Belarus.&nbsp;\nWe highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your&#8239;travel insurance provider&#8239;about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.","advisoryUrl":"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/belarus-travel-advisory.html","redditN":0,"visaEase":50,"visaEaseUS":"unknown","gdpPerCapitaUsd":8316.64776291533,"visaType":"evisa","visaAllowedDays":30,"visaNotes":"The U.S. government advises its citizens not to visit Belarus due to the Belarusian authorities’ arbitrary enforcement of local laws, the risk of detention, the continued facilitation of Russia’s war against Ukraine , the potential of civil unrest, and the Embassy’s limited ability to assist U.S. citizens residing in or traveling to Belarus.

Tensions between communal or tribal groups may lead to&#8239;civil unrest&#8239;involving violence and can occur without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital, Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources.\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain authorization before traveling to certain areas, including the central part of Bougainville and the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands (excluding Mt.

Travelers by boat should reconsider travel to the Bismarck and Solomon Seas along Papua New Guinea's north and eastern coasts. In 2021 and 2022, the Embassy was aware of at least three occasions in which sailboats operated by or carrying U.S. citizens were boarded by criminals. The criminals, who have been known to use physical violence, robbed the boats, and in one incident, severely injured the captain when he attempted to fight back. &nbsp;\nVisit our website on&#8239;International Maritime Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea.\nKidnapping&#8239;for ransom or political influence occurs in Papua New Guinea, though foreign nationals are not frequently targeted. In February 2023, a foreign national was kidnapped. In late 2022, foreign nationals employed by an international company were kidnapped and held for several days. &#8239;\nTravelers should exercise increased caution when traveling in remote areas of Papua New Guinea due to the presence of&#8239;unexploded ordnance (UXO)&#8239;remaining from the Second World War. UXO is discovered infrequently throughout the country, often on smaller islands.\nPapua New Guinea has&#8239;inconsistent availability of healthcare services. &nbsp;Healthcare may be difficult to obtain outside of Port Moresby. &nbsp;Pharmaceuticals may be scarce or unavailable.\nPapua New Guinea is subject to periodic seismic activity and is home to several active volcanoes. The country does experience regular volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. U.S. citizens are advised to familiarize themselves with&#8239;volcano updates,&#8239;earthquake tracking, and&#8239;tsunami warnings&#8239;in Papua New Guinea.

Hagen and Goroka, due to&#8239;civil unrest.\n\nCountry Summary:&#8239;&nbsp;Violent crime, including sexual assault, carjackings, home invasions, and armed robberies, is common. There have been reports of criminals attacking resorts popular with foreign tourists to steal goods and money. Tensions between communal or tribal groups may lead to&#8239;civil unrest&#8239;involving violence and can occur without warning. Police presence is limited outside of the capital, Port Moresby, and police may be unable to assist due to limited resources.\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Port Moresby due to limited transportation infrastructure. U.S. government employees must obtain authorization before traveling to certain areas, including the central part of Bougainville and the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands (excluding Mt. Hagen), Eastern Highlands (excluding Goroka), Hela, Enga, Jiwaka, and other areas of Papua New Guinea where one is unable to fly directly.\nPiracy&#8239;is active in the waters surrounding Papua New Guinea. Travelers by boat should reconsider travel to the Bismarck and Solomon Seas along Papua New Guinea's north and eastern coasts. In 2021 and 2022, the Embassy was aware of at least three occasions in which sailboats operated by or carrying U.S. citizens were boarded by criminals. The criminals, who have been known to use physical violence, robbed the boats, and in one incident, severely injured the captain when he attempted to fight back. &nbsp;\nVisit our website on&#8239;International Maritime Piracy and Armed Robbery at Sea.\nKidnapping&#8239;for ransom or political influence occurs in Papua New Guinea, though foreign nationals are not frequently targeted. In February 2023, a foreign national was kidnapped. In late 2022, foreign nationals employed by an international company were kidnapped and held for several days. &#8239;\nTravelers should exercise increased caution when traveling in remote areas of Papua New Guinea due to the presence of&#8239;unexploded ordnance (UXO)&#8239;remaining from the Second World War. UXO is discovered infrequently throughout the country, often on smaller islands.\nPapua New Guinea has&#8239;inconsistent availability of healthcare services. &nbsp;Healthcare may be difficult to obtain outside of Port Moresby. &nbsp;Pharmaceuticals may be scarce or unavailable.\nPapua New Guinea is subject to periodic seismic activity and is home to several active volcanoes. The country does experience regular volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis. U.S. citizens are advised to familiarize themselves with&#8239;volcano updates,&#8239;earthquake tracking, and&#8239;tsunami warnings&#8239;in Papua New Guinea. U.S. citizens should develop contingency plans in the event of an eruption or major earthquake. &#8239;\nRead the&#8239;country information page&#8239;for additional information on travel to Papua New Guinea.\nIf you decide to travel to Papua New Guinea:\n\nDo not use local taxis or buses, known as public motor vehicles or PMVs.\nTravel with guides from a reputable tour company, particularly if you plan to hike.\nAvoid walking or driving at night.\nAvoid areas in the vicinity of active volcanoes.\nDo not physically resist any robbery attempt.\nAvoid demonstrations and crowds.\nDo not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.\nBring a sufficient supply of over-the-counter and prescription medicines.\nAvoid sailing around the waters of Papua New Guinea and review the&#8239;Live Piracy Report&#8239;published by the International Maritime Bureau.\nIf sailing, have functioning communication and emergency equipment, such as a satellite phone, VHF radio, and emergency position indicating radio beacons (EPIRB).\nReview our&#8239;crisis and disaster abroad webpage.\nReview the&#8239;CDC&#8217;s suggestions on preparing for natural disasters.\nEnroll in the&#8239;Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)&#8239;to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\nReview the&#8239;Country Security Report&#8239;for Papua New Guinea.\nVisit the CDC page for the latest&#8239;Travel Health Information&#8239;related to your travel.\nPrepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the&#8239;Traveler&#8217;s Checklist.\nWe highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your travel insurance provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.\n\nAreas Near the Panguna Mine on the island of Bougainville &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel\nThe Autonomous Bougainville Government has designated areas near the Panguna mine as a &#8220;no go zones&quot; due to the risk of violence from civil unrest. Bougainville police lack the resources to respond to emergency calls.\nVisit our website for&#8239;Travel to High-Risk Areas. Do not travel to this area for any reason.\nThe Highlands Region (excluding Mt. Hagen and Goroka) &#8211; Level 4: Do Not Travel\nThere is a heightened risk of civil unrest from tribal violence throughout the region, including the provinces of Southern Highlands, Western Highlands, Eastern Highlands, Hela, Enga, and Jiwaka. The towns of Mt. Hagen (Western Highlands) and Goroka (Eastern Highlands) generally have a more stable police presence than other towns and villages across the Highlands provinces.

Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the United States to Russia is nearly impossible.\nAir travel\nThere are few commercial air travel options available. It may not be easy to book flights on short notice. If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time.\nClick&nbsp;here&nbsp;for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2 due to safety concerns. U.S. government personnel outside of Russia generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns.\nAdditionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights within certain areas of Russian airspace, by issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM).

They may delay or deny U.S. consular assistance.\nRussian security services target foreign nationals and international organizations considered &#8220;undesirable.&#8221;\nRussian law allows authorities to punish foreigners for treason. This includes working for organizations that Russia perceives as acting against Russian interests. Former and current U.S. government employees and contractors should pay special attention to this part of Russian law.\n\nSecurity\nThere have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.\nRussia's war in Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar.\nUnder martial law, authorities can:\n\nSet curfews\nSeize property\nRestrict movement\nDetain foreigners\nForcibly relocate residents\nLimit public gatherings\n\nRussian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for &#8220;acting against Russia's interests.&#8221; Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting &quot;anti-Russian&quot; groups. They have punished people for criticizing the government or military.\nLGB travelers\nThe Russian government's current &quot;propaganda&quot; law bans discussion of LGB topics. The community has been labeled as extremist, and it is considered a crime to support the human rights of LGB people in Russia. Displaying certain symbols, including the rainbow flag, is a crime.\nTerrorism\nTerrorists continue to plan and carry out attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident in Moscow proved terrorists can strike suddenly.\nU.S. government employees working in Russia are prohibited from traveling to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus.\nRussian annexation of territories\nThe international community does not recognize Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya.\nRussia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea. There is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas and intense fighting across these regions.\nRussian authorities have abused foreigners and locals. In particular, they have targeted people who they see as opposing Russia&#8217;s authority.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine offers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the ongoing war limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.\nIf you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and decide to travel to Russia:\n\nThe Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals is significant.\nBe ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.\nPrepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.

U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who have joined protests. Russians and U.S. citizens have been detained for posts on social media.\nElectronic devices\nReconsider bringing electronic devices into Russia. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices. This includes information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.\nDebit and credit cards\nU.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the United States to Russia is nearly impossible.\nAir travel\nThere are few commercial air travel options available. It may not be easy to book flights on short notice. If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time.\nClick&nbsp;here&nbsp;for Information for U.S. Citizens Seeking to Depart Russia.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Russia's air safety rating from Category 1 to Category 2 due to safety concerns. U.S. government personnel outside of Russia generally are not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns.\nAdditionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights within certain areas of Russian airspace, by issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of these certain areas. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices.\nLaws and special circumstances\nRussian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips.\n\nU.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.\nRussian authorities do not always notify the U.S. Embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen. They may delay or deny U.S. consular assistance.\nRussian security services target foreign nationals and international organizations considered &#8220;undesirable.&#8221;\nRussian law allows authorities to punish foreigners for treason. This includes working for organizations that Russia perceives as acting against Russian interests. Former and current U.S. government employees and contractors should pay special attention to this part of Russian law.\n\nSecurity\nThere have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.\nRussia's war in Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar.\nUnder martial law, authorities can:\n\nSet curfews\nSeize property\nRestrict movement\nDetain foreigners\nForcibly relocate residents\nLimit public gatherings\n\nRussian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for &#8220;acting against Russia's interests.&#8221; Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting &quot;anti-Russian&quot; groups. They have punished people for criticizing the government or military.\nLGB travelers\nThe Russian government's current &quot;propaganda&quot; law bans discussion of LGB topics. The community has been labeled as extremist, and it is considered a crime to support the human rights of LGB people in Russia. Displaying certain symbols, including the rainbow flag, is a crime.\nTerrorism\nTerrorists continue to plan and carry out attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall incident in Moscow proved terrorists can strike suddenly.\nU.S. government employees working in Russia are prohibited from traveling to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus.\nRussian annexation of territories\nThe international community does not recognize Russia&#8217;s annexation of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya.\nRussia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea. There is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas and intense fighting across these regions.\nRussian authorities have abused foreigners and locals. In particular, they have targeted people who they see as opposing Russia&#8217;s authority.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine offers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the ongoing war limits the Embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.\nIf you choose to disregard the Travel Advisory and decide to travel to Russia:\n\nThe Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals is significant.\nBe ready for the possibility of detention for an unknown amount of time, possibly without a clear reason, and without the ability to contact your embassy or anyone else for help.\nPrepare a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or power of attorney.\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip.\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care and custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\nDevelop a communication plan with family, your employer or host organization. List how and when you'll confirm you're safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.\nHave evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. Read the information on what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in an emergency overseas.\nVisit our website on Travel to High-Risk areas.\nConsider the risks involved in having dual U.S.-Russian nationality.\nLog out of all social media accounts and do not access your social media accounts while in Russia.\nKeep travel documents up-to-date and easily accessible.\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages and alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency. &nbsp;\nReview the Country Security Report for Russia.\nPrepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the Traveler&#8217;s Checklist.\nVisit the CDC page for the latest Travel Health Information related to your travel and return to the United States.\nWe highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your travel insurance provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.","advisoryUrl":"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/russia-travel-advisory.html","redditN":0,"visaEase":30,"visaEaseUS":"unknown","gdpPerCapitaUsd":14889.0185546875,"visaType":"visa_required","visaNotes":"72-hour visa-free transit for international cruise ship/ferry passengers only if travelling with an organized tour and accompanied at all times by a tour operator. Registration required after 7 business days. Russia signed the \"Shared Values Visa\" law on August 19, 2024, aimed at simplifying the residence permits for citizens of countries that do not conform to Russia's traditional spirit and values. This means that one can obtain a three-month temporary residency without passing the exam. The focus of this law is to simplify the residence permit for foreign citizens with traditional Russian spirit and values. As long as they comply with Russian values, foreign citizens do not need to prove their knowledge of Russian language, Russian history, or Russian law (without examination), and can obtain a temporary residence permit for three months. By simplifying the process, more people can be attracted to settle in Russia, and these foreign citizens must come from countries that oppose Russian values. This list applies to 47 regions, including United States. American citizens may receive multiple-entry visas valid for three years. Residents of Alaska who are members of the indigenous population do not require a visa to visit Chukotka Autonomous Okrug if they have relatives (blood relatives, members of the same tribe, native people who have similar language and cultural heritage) in Chukotka. Individuals must be invited by a relative in Chukotka and must leave Chukotka within 90 days. Entry points are in Anadyr , Provideniya , Lavrentiya and Uelen . The U.S. government advises its citizens not to visit Russia for any reason for the following reasons: Danger associated with the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine . The risk of harassment or wrongful detention by Russian security officials. The arbitrary enforcement of local laws. The possibility of terrorism. US citizens in Russia are advised to leave immediately.","visaSource":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_United_States_citizens","scoreTotal":33}},{"iso2":"RW","iso3":"RWA","m49":646,"name":"Rwanda","officialName":"Republic of Rwanda","region":"Africa","subregion":"Eastern Africa","aliases":["RW","Republic of Rwanda","Repubulika y'u Rwanda","République du Rwanda","Rwanda","undefined"],"territory":false,"lat":-2,"lng":30,"currency":"RWF","languages":["eng","fra","kin"],"advisory":{"level":2,"updatedAt":"2025-07-16T04:00:00.000Z","url":"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/rwanda-travel-advisory.html","summary":"Updated to remove the Level 4: Do Not Travel area near the border with Burundi and to reflect changes to the Level 4: Do Not Travel areas near the border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\nExercise increased caution in Rwanda due to the potential for armed violence.

Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.\nViolent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.\nReporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel working in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan.

Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip\nEstablish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.\nDevelop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you'll contact first to share the information.\nChoose one family member to serve as the point of contact.

Weapons are readily available to the population. In addition, cattle raids occur throughout the country and often lead to violence.\nViolent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings are common throughout South Sudan, including Juba. Foreign nationals have been the victims of rape, sexual assault, armed robberies, and other violent crimes.\nReporting in South Sudan without the proper documentation from the South Sudanese Media Authority is considered illegal, and any journalistic work there is very dangerous. Journalists regularly report being harassed in South Sudan, and many have been killed while covering the conflict.\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in South Sudan. U.S. government personnel working in South Sudan are under a strict curfew. They must use armored vehicles for nearly all movements, and official travel outside Juba is limited. Due to the critical crime threat in Juba, walking is also restricted; when allowed, it is limited to a small area in the immediate vicinity of the Embassy and during daylight hours only. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and/or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of South Sudan. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the Federal Aviation Administration&#8217;s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices. Read the&nbsp;country information page&nbsp;for additional information on travel to South Sudan.\nIf you decide to travel to South Sudan:\n\nExercise extreme care in all parts of the country, including Juba. Travel outside of Juba with a minimum of two vehicles along with appropriate recovery and medical equipment in case of mechanical failure or other emergency.\nAvoid travel along border areas.\nAvoid demonstrations and crowds.\nBe aware that photography in public is strictly controlled, and you are required to obtain authorization from the Ministry of Information before taking any photographs or video in public &#8211; including while inside a vehicle.\nCheck local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans.\nWe highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your travel insurance provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.\nEnroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\nReview your personal security plan and visit our page on travel to high risk areas.\nDraft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones. This is so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States. Review this list of documents to prepare for your trip\nEstablish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization, or consider consulting with a professional security organization. Your plan should include sheltering in place, maintaining outside communication, and a personal evacuation plan via commercial means.\nDevelop a communication plan with family or your employer or host organization (if you are traveling on business). This is so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you'll contact first to share the information.\nChoose one family member to serve as the point of contact. They will communicate with kidnappers/hostage-takers, media, U.S. and host country government agencies, and members of Congress if you are kidnapped or taken hostage.\nEstablish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. This is so that if you are taken hostage, your loved ones can know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to be sure that you are alive (and to rule out a hoax).\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\nErase any sensitive photos, comments, or other materials from your social media pages, cameras, laptops, and other electronic devices that could be considered controversial or provocative by local groups.\nLeave your expensive/sentimental belongings behind.\nReview the&nbsp;Country Security Report&nbsp;for South Sudan.\nU.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.

Read the entire Travel Advisory.\nSome regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones.\nLevel 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr. \nRussia&#8217;s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law.\nAll U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable.\nU.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications &#8211; which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor &#8211; that announce air alerts in real time, such as Air Raid Siren and Alarm Map. The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.\nOn February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.\nUkrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine. For more information on traveling with dual nationality, please visit our Travelers with Dual Nationality page.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA&#8217;s&nbsp;Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices.\nU.S. citizens seeking assistance, including routine services, should email KyivACS@state.gov. Please review what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas.\nThe Embassy is open and operating in Kyiv; however, Embassy personnel are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions, which may cause delays in provision of consular assistance to U.S. citizens outside of Kyiv.\nOccupied Territories:\nMost of the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia&#8217;s purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia&#8217;s occupation.\nThere are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality.

Read the entire Travel Advisory.\nSome regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones.\nLevel 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr. \nRussia&#8217;s unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law.\nAll U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable.\nU.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications &#8211; which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor &#8211; that announce air alerts in real time, such as Air Raid Siren and Alarm Map. The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.\nOn February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.\nUkrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine. For more information on traveling with dual nationality, please visit our Travelers with Dual Nationality page.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine.

There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia&#8217;s occupation.\nThere are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus.\nAlthough Russia&#8217;s occupation severely restricts the Embassy&#8217;s access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia &#8211; Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\nRead the country information page for additional information on travel to Ukraine.\nTravel to High-Risk Areas:\nIf you choose to travel to Ukraine, you should consider taking the following steps:\n\nVisit our website on Travel to High-Risk areas.\nDraft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\nShare important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\nEstablish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host&nbsp;organization or&nbsp;consider consulting with a professional security organization.\nDevelop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.
